# API reference

The Nuggit API is organized around REST.
The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses.

## Errors

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
In general, there are three status code ranges you can expect:
* `2xx` confirms that your request worked as expected.
* `4xx` indicates an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a parameter is invalid, a repository already exists, etc.).
* `5xx` indicates an error with the server (these are rare).

### The error object

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `code` | `string` | A short string with a brief explanation of the error. See [error codes](#error-codes) for details. |
| `message` | `string` | A human-readable message providing more details about the error. |

### Error codes

The following list describes some error codes that could be handled programmatically, along with additional information about how to resolve them.

* `repo_exists`

    The repository `name` provided already exists.
    Use a different, unique value for `name` and try again.

* `repo_name_invalid`

    The repository `name` provided is invalid.
    See error `message` for validation details.

* `repo_description_invalid`

    The repository `description` provided is invalid.
    See error `message` for validation details.
